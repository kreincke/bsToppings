# bsToppings : *material to* p*imp* y*our* b*oot*S*core*

(little supporting snippets)

[bootScore](https://bootscore.me) is an excellent theme for WordPress that wants to do once for all the work that everyone has to do when she wants to incorporate [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) into herWordPress theme. *bootScore* is free software, licensed under the MIT license.  

The **upside** is that the developers of *[bootScore](https://github.com/bootscore)* want to stay as close to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) as possible: what doesn't exist there, shouldn't be built in here. So users always know what they get: a real Bootstrap-based theme. But the advantage is also a **downsize**: Sometimes the web designer wants more. So, she would have to invent that beyond *bootScore*. Although others might have found solutions for this long ago.

The **bsToppings** repository shall collect such secondary solutions: It **shall offer _MIT licensed snippets_ for expanding the bootScore functionality**. And it shall describe, how to do that.
