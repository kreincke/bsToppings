# My Landing Page with 1 sticky post and 1 latest post

## Purpose

A landing page should show the reader what is most important to him. And it should do so at first glance.  Mostly, the most recent post is the most important part of a blog. But sometimes the most recent sticky post is also important. The template *mylap-sp1rp1.php* offers such a door into the site.
